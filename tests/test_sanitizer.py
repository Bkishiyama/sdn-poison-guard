""" tests/test_sanitizer.py
This is for Tool 2 Unit Tests: Model Poisoning Sanitizer
Test:
1. Healthy network behavior - no poisoning should be detected in clean data
2. Single poisoned host - detection and rejection of a malicious node, host 6
3. Multiple poisoned hosts - works when more than one adversarial host
4. Edge cases: empty input, single host, two hosts, and values are all the same
5. Vector sanitizer - handles a host when it sends a vector instead of a single number
6. Z-threshold sensitivity - to determine if valid as strictness is adjusted
Usage -> python3 -m pytest tests/test_sanitizer.py -v
