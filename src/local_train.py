""" local_train.py 
Local Model Training for Each Client
This script trains an Isolation Forest model on a single client's 
SDN flow data. Each client trains independently.
The model learns what normal traffic looks like without using labels.
We save the model + scaler + stats so it can be used later in the 
federated aggregation step.
