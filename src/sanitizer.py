''' Scalar Sanitizer
Add and aggregate client updates to the FL model; eliminate abnormalities by using Z-score outlier filtering
Parameter: key (str) is the host_id
Parameter: value (float) is the scalar value of the host's update
This is the central server's entry point where each client uploads a single scalar value.
The function computes the mean and standard deviation of all submitted values,
then applies a Z-score threshold (cutoff if above) to determine if a client's update is an outlier or not.
If the client's update is an outlier, it is rejected and not included in the aggregated model.
Otherwise, the client's update is accepted and included in the aggregated model.
Return: global model, or the federated average of accepted hosts
Return: Each hosts details
